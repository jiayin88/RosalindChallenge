# RosalindChallenge

Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.
This repository aims to showcase the learning growth since year 2015 till 2019. Not the optimal but it's good to see how codes are written overtime.

It's a combination of done and in progress. I cannot really recall which is working and which is not because it was a progressive thing and I cannot access Rosalind anymore. If you want to know which is working, just check out my profile : http://rosalind.info/users/jiayin88/ alright? ;)
 
I may have changed some codes overtime too just to try out different styles. Any feedbacks are welcome!
