# RosalindChallenge

Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.
This repository aims to showcase the learning growth since year 2015 till 2019. Guess which are in year 2019? If I'm not mistaken only 4 or 5 of them is in year 2019. Most were back in 2016 and 2017. Hint: It's the harder ones. Not the optimal but it's good to see how codes are written overtime.


Not all the codes are uploaded tho. No new challenges will be completed as I can't access Rosalind since year 2019. If you want to know what codes has been completed, just check out my profile : http://rosalind.info/users/jiayin88/ alright? ;)
