# RosalindChallenge

Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.
This repository aims to showcase the learning growth from year 2015 till the present.
Not the optimal but it's good to see how codes are written overtime.

It's a combination of done and in progress. I may have changed some codes overtime too just to try out different styles. Any feedbacks are welcome!
